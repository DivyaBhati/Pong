# Project Proposal

## The Plan
For this project I would like to recreate Pong in C++.  However, I won't just stop at the primitive player vs. CPU pong game that we've seen countless times before.  I plan on implementing various extra user options.  The player can choose between different level of CPU difficulty as well as optionally playing a 2-player game.  Along with that I plan on adding sprite animations for basic actions like when a paddle strikes the ball or if the ball goes off the screen.  It could be a "Blood Magic" sort of thing.  If time permits, I would also like to add an option for the user to be able to choose their game color scheme (dark, neon, light, rainbow, etc.).  Obviously I'm throwing a lot of ideas out there right now, but I will make sure to have the basic game run before moving onto anything more complex.

## Resources
Since Pong has been done countless times before, I want to place stress on the asthetics of the game.  For the text and styling, I will be usnig the [ofxTrueTypeFontUC library](https://github.com/hironishihara/ofxTrueTypeFontUC).  This will allow for mto use my own custom fonts which I plan on pulling from https://www.dafont.com/.  For the game sprites, I plan on creating them in Adobe Photoshop and importing them into the application using the ofImage library.
