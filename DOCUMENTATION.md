Have a basic paddle that can move on arrow keys pressed.  Paddle can't exit screen, and also created ball object.  Worked 2 hours on this so far.

**Tuesday, April 24th**
Made a second paddle object and created a game class.  Planning on moving the move functions into this Game object because the ball doesn't have access to each paddle's coordinates.

Successfully created new Game object.  Game now runs two player Pong.  Need to make intro screen, score screen, and a CPU.
