Have a basic paddle that can move on arrow keys pressed.  Paddle can't exit screen, and also created ball object.  Worked 2 hours on this so far.

**Tuesday, April 24th**
Made a second paddle object and created a game class.  Planning on moving the move functions into this Game object because the ball doesn't have access to each paddle's coordinates.

Successfully created new Game object.  Game now runs two player Pong.  Need to make intro screen, score screen, and a CPU.

**Saturday, April 28th**
Added a start screen where user can choose between one or two players.  Also made game get increasingly difficult as each round progresses.  Game also keeps track of the scores and shows it at the end of each round.  Need to add custom fonts next.
